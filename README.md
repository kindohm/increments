# Increments

This is a creative project that stores the text-based resources used
to create audio and web content. 

All of the creative stuff is in [/sketches](/sketches). Binary resources
such as samples, .wav files, .mp3 files, and DAW files have been
excluded. I might make them available someday, but it's potentially
gigabytes of binary files that don't belong here.

All of the web site building stuff is in [/site](/site) and [/scripts](/scripts). 
It's pretty gross.
